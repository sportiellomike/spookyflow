# spookyflow
This R package includes functions to spook users away from manually gating on their flow cytometry data. It is not intended to replace an actual human from spot-checking and conducting a careful analysis. Rather, to give users something to quickly cluster and visualize data.

This is not intended for use outside of our lab, but I mean hey if you're here you found us so go ahead and use some stuff, just cite us. 

Most of these functions were written by Nate Laniewski, with some input by me (Mike Sportiello).
